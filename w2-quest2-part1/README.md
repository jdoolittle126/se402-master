## Quest 2

In this quest, we implement our own version of strategy pattern. I created a class called SortingConfiguration, which holds a sorting behavior and a sorting method. The behavior defines the way the given array is sorted (Least to greatest, etc.) and the method defines how the array is sorted (Bubble sort, etc.)
