## Quest 1

In this quest, we use what we have learned about classes to create a 'Duck' class. My implementation creates ASCII ducks based on the parameters the user enters.

	Enter your duck's length (Must be integer above 0): 
	3
	Enter your duck's color (This will replace the ____): 
	red
	Enter your duck's eye (This can be up to two characters, such as oo): 
	o
	Enter your duck's legs (This can be up to two characters larger than the wingspan, such as | |): 
	| |
	   __     
	 <(o )_____ 
	  ( .___> / 
	   `-----'  
	    | |     
	Enjoy your red duck!
